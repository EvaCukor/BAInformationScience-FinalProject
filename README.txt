This is an accent-morphological generator for Croatian verbs written in Python in 2009 as part of the final thesis for the BA in Information Science at the University of Zagreb. 

The generator consists of a Python script generator.py (using UTF-8 encoding) and a database with two tables: one with a list of Croatian verbs taken from the Croatian Valency Lexicon of Verbs (http://theta.ffzg.hr/crovallex/) and one containing the generated verb forms with appropriate accents.

The generator generates all verb forms with accents for two- and three-syllable verbs in accordance with the list of Croatian verb models with described conjugation and accentual paradigms taken from the PhD dissertation of the mentor for this thesis. Multiple-syllable verbs are not covered by this thesis, but their accentual and conjugation rules are almost identical to those of three-syllable verbs, so they could be easily coded.
